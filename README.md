## Overview

TabSplit helps you split bills and shared expenses with ease. It performs all calculations in your browser and uses the URL hash to store and share state, eliminating the need for a database and ensuring complete privacy. The application supports both manual data entry and automated receipt processing using OpenAI's API.

- **State Management:** React Hook Form, URL hash-based state
- **Validation:** Zod

## Architecture

### Client-Centric Design

The application operates entirely client-side with all calculations, data manipulation, and state management happening in the user's browser. This ensures no sensitive information is ever transmitted to or stored on a server.

### Stateless Data Handling

Instead of a traditional database, the application state is serialized and stored in the URL's hash fragment:

1. User inputs data in the TabForm
2. Form state (TabSchema) is serialized to a query string
3. String is appended to the URL hash (/split#...)
4. On page load, useHash hook parses and validates the hash data

### API Routes

Two serverless API routes support optional features:

- `/api/processReceiptUpload` - Handles receipt scanning via OpenAI API
- `/api/og` - Generates dynamic social media preview images
